## WIKI
1. Feature module
  - used to group together components directives, services, other related artifacts
    - that work together to provide a specific feature or fx

## Angular Modules:
  - containers that adheres to the same functionality
    - by domain
      - orders, customers, etc.
    - by user workflow
      - order checkout, user registration

Sample: `app.module.ts`
```ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; 
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({ // used to define Angular Module
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  import: [
    BrowserModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [
    AppComponent
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```
### NgModule
  - used to define Angular Module
  - an Angular decorator similar to TS decorator
  - NG Mmodules usually do not contain any logic
    - purpose is to group artifacts with similar fx
  - Purpose of the maind app module is to orchestrate the intaraction of feature modules throughout the application
  - properties:
    - `declarations`
      - contain ng artifacts that share common fc bound to a specif application
      - artifacts that can be added to this property are:
        - NG Components
        - directives
        - pipes
    - `imports`
      - contains other NG modules that needed by current module
        - when some features are need from other modules
      - it is like a dependency
    - `providers`
      - contains special purpose Angular artifacts that are called `services`
        - `Services` handles complex tasks in an NG app, such as
          - HTTP Endpoint
          - interacting with a browser API
    - `bootstrap`
      - defines the component that will be loaded at app startup
      - set only once in the main app module, usually the main component

### Creating a first module:
```bash
ng generate module products
# OUTPUT
CREATE src/app/products/products.module.ts (194 bytes)
```
After creating a module:
  - Add the module in the `imports` property from the `app.module.ts`
```ts
@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    ProductsModule, // newly generated module
  ]
  ...
})
``` 

### Angular Module Heirarchy

### Organizing Modules

1. **Core module**
   - contains app-wide artifacts that do not fit a specific module
   - located in `core.module.ts` 
   - ex: 
     - components that are loaded once in an application
       - top bar that contains the main menu
       - footer component with copy right info
       - loading spinner
     - services that can be shared among modules
       - local cache service
       - custom logger
2. **Shared module**
   - contains ng artifacts such as components, directives and pipes
   - may also provide a container for other exported modules that container reusable artifacts
   - `shared.module.ts`

### How NG loads modules:

1. **Eager-loaded modules**
   - loaded at the app start up
   - if it is declared in the `imports` array of other module, it is eagerly loaded
2. **Lazy-loaded modules**
   - loaded on-demand
   - usually due to in-app navigation
   - they are not declared in the `imports` array

### Angular built-in modules
1. BrowserModule
   - run ng apps in the browser
   - must imported only once in an ng app
2. CommonModule
   - contains specific ng artifacts that support ng template syntax
   - ex: 
     - directives for looping or displaying HTML content conditionally
     - applying CSS styles in HTML
3. FormsModule/ReactiveFormsModule:
   - build forms for interacting with user input data
4. HttpClientModule:
   - enables communication and data exchange with a remote endpoint over HTTP
5. RouterModule:
   - handles navigation
6. BrowserAnimationsModule:
   - cooperates with the ng material library
   - enables UI animations
