Networking.

LAN, Switch, Router

LAN - local area network
  - collection of devices connected together in one physical location
  - Each device has a unique IP address
  - device communicate via these IP address

IP address example - 32 bit value
Ex 172.16.0.0
  - separeted by dots - octets
  - 4 octets
  0000 0000 (0) - 1111 1111 (255)

Ip addresses can range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

How do devices talk to each other
  - task of a LAN device called Switch

Switch
  - sits within the LAN
  - Facilitates the connection between all the devices within the LAN
  - laptop can talk to a phone or a printer via a switch

How to talk to devices outside LAN for example a server like facebook (server)?
  - accessing any website
  - for connecting outside of LAN it is the task of Router

Router 
  - sits between LAN and outside networks (WAN)
  - connects devices on LAN and WAN
  - allows networked devices to acess the internet  

If you want to open facebook app on your phone
1. Your phone will send a request to the router
2. The router will send a request to the facebook server over the internet

The IP address of the server is called - GATEWAY

When a device in LAN sends a request to another device,
How to know whether the other device is inside or outside the LAN.
  - this is decided based on the IP address of the TARGET/DEST device
  - devices in the LAN belong to same IP address range

Subnet 
  - logical subdivision of an IP network

Subnetting 
  - process of dividing a network into two or more networks

Subnet Example
  [1] 192.168.0.0
    - IP address - starting point of IP range, the first IP in the range
  [2] 255.255.255.0
    - subnet mask - sets the range

IP address range
  range             ip address        subnet mask
  starting point    192.168.0.X       255.255.255.0
  end point         192.168.x.X       255.255.0.0

Every IP that looks like these: 192.168.0.x - it belongs to the LAN
  
255.255.255.0 - means that 24(8 + 8 + 8) bits are fixed
255.255.0.0 - means that 16 (8 + 8) bits are fixed

Value 255 fixates the Octet
Value 0 means free range

Subnet Mask dictates how many bits are fixed

CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing > shorthand
192.168.0.0/16 > /16 bits are fixed
192.168.0.0/24 > /24 bits are fixed


Lan Device(1) -> Switch -> Router -> internet
Lan Device(2) ---/  |
Lan Device(3) ------/


Any device needs 3 pieces of data for communications
  with other devices both within the LAN and outside devices
1. IP adddress
2. Subnet
3. Gateway

-------------------------------
Network Address Translation (NAT)
  > IP address range chosen by an administrator
  > Each device gets a unique IP from that range

How do we make sure that every network admin select the same range,
and make sure that IP addresses dont overlap
  > Ip adress within the LAN are NOT VISIBLE TO THE OUTSIDE NETWORK or internet

Ex: send a request to facebook
phone(192.168.1.10) -> Switch (192.168.1.1) -> Router (10.0.0.3) -> Facebook Server (69.63..176.13)
  - 192.168.1.10 will be converted by the IP address of the router (10.0.0.3)
  - NAT (Network Address Translation)
    - key functionality of the router

Benefits of NAT
  1. security
    > bc your IP address is not directly exposed
  2. Reuse IP address
    > 2 orgs can have the same IP address range within their local area network
    > there are limited number of IPv4 addresses available 
      > 2^32 or 4_294_957_296 public addresses

What if an outside device wants to talk to your LAN directly
  Ex. you have a server of your app, so you want to able to access requests outside the LAN
  - by default these type of communication is not allowed because of the concept of Firewall
  - server is not accessible from outside the LAN

Firewall
  - a system that prevent unauthorized accessed from entering a private network
  - a set of rules that protect a network from unauthorized access
  - using Firewall Rules you can define, which requests are allowed

Firewall Rules
  - which IP address in your network is accessible
  - which IP address can access your server
  - you can e.g. allow any device access your application

EX:
  Inbound
  Type        Protocol      Port Range      Sources
  SSH         TCP           22              178.191.162.12
  Custom      TCP           3000            All IPv4
  Custom      TCP           8081            All IPv4

Port Range - which port is accessible on the server or the device you want to exposed

Port
  - each device has a set of ports (doors)
    - you can unlock some doors so that guests can enter
  - each device has a set of ports
  - You can allow specific ports(doors) AND specific IP address (guests)
  - Different applications listen on specific ports
  - (Default) Standard ports for many applications
    - port 80 - Web Servers - most web applications
      - Ex: Request to FB server on port 80 
    - port 3306 - MySQL db
    - port 5432 - PostgresQL DB
  - For every application you need a port
  - Each port is unique on a device
  - allows IP address at port to be accessed
    - Port-Forwarding (Configuration)

DNS - Domain Name Service
  - every computer on the network is uniquely identified by IP address
  - but when you visit facebook,
    you request: www.facebook.com
    not the ip address: https://69.63.175.13
    > why ?
    - bc. facebook.com runs on many computers which each have its own IP address
    - humans are bettter in remembering words and names instead of numbers
  - translates domain names to IP addresses

How does DNS manage all these IP addresses
  - DNS uses policy / Heirarchical structure
  Root Domains
  Top Level Domains
    6 original TLDs
      - .mil - military
      - .edu - education
      - .com - commercial, generic
      - .org - non profit orgs
      - .net - networking technologies, but today generic
    geographical domains
      - .de - germany
      - .us - US
      - .ph - ph
  - you can buy a domain name
  - who manages these names, who can sell these domain names, regulates by whomm
    - Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
  
Subdomains
  
How does the DNS Resolution work
  - Every computer has a DNS client pre installed
  - Resolve facebook.com or find the ip address mapped by facebook.com
  - Will call the Resolver by the ISP 
    - is IP address in Cache? 
    - if yes return the IP
    - if no, will go to one of the 13 root request Servers
      - roots servers are redundantly available across the world

DNS Entries are cached for efficiency

Networking commands
  ipconfig
  netstat
    - shows active connectiions in the machine
    - which app are actively listening on ports
  ps aux
    - how much computer resources they are consuming
  nslookup
    - ip address of any domain name
    - can do reverse check to check the domain name of ip address
  ping
    - check whether a service is accessible
