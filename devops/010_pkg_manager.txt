Software package 
  - a compressed archive, containing all requred files
  - depends on other software to run

Package Manager 
  - ensures the integrity and authenticity of the package
  - manages and resolves all required dependencies
  - Package manager knows where to install software across different /bin, /folder
  - easy upgrading of the software
  - 1 central place to install, upgrade, configure, remove software

Package Manager is already included in every Linux Distribution
in Ubuntu, there is APT, advance Package Tool

  Debian based distros uses APT and APT-GET
    - Ubuntu
    - Debian
    - Linux Mint

  Red Hat based distros uses YUM
    - RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
    - CentOS
    - Fedora

Command:
  apt - this will show the help section

  ## SEARCHING
  apt search [package_name] - search a software package 
    EX: apt search openjdk
    - if not working, add sudo
    - sudo apt search openjdk
  PRO TIP: if you enter java command in terminal without java installed,
  it will show you list of suggestions of software package you want to install

  ## INSTALLING
  sudo apt install [pkg_name_1] [pkg_name_2]
  sudo apt install opendjdk-19-jre-headless
  
  ## UNINSTALLING 
  sudo apt remove [pkg_name_1]

## Difference of APT and APT-GET
  apt is more user friendly that apt-get
  search command is available in apt

Where do these packages come from?
  - Repositories
    - storage location, containing thousands of programs

PRO TIP: Before installing, always update the package index before upgrading or installing new packages
  - sudo apt update
    - this command refreshes the state of the repositories

Alternative ways to install software
  - There are packages, that are not available in these official repositories
  - it may be available, but not the latest version
  - Ex: Browsers, Code Editors, etc

Alternatives:
  1. Ubuntu Software Application
    - uses Snap Package Manager
  2. Snappy / Snap Package Manager
    - self contained - dependencies contained in the package
    - a snap is a bundle of an app and its dependencies
    - snap store - provides a place for uploading snaps
    - snapcraft - format of the file
    - SNAP VS APT 
      - Snap is self contained - dependencies contained in the package
        - supports universal Linux packages (package type .snap)
        - automatic updates
        - larger installation size
      - APT - dependencies are shared and distributed
        - Only for specific Linux Distros (package type .deb)
        - Manual updates
        - Smaller installation size

    - Use APT first, and if package not available use Snap
  
  3. Add Repository to official list of repositories
    - add-apt-repository
      - it will be added to /etc/apt/sources/list

    When install relatively new applications, which are not in official repositories yet

    - now if package is available now in a repository, you can now use apt install

    PPA - Personal Package archive
      - are provided by the community
      - "personal" - not verified, be aware of possible risks
