Operating Systems

components
  1. CPU
  2. memory
  3. Storage
  4. I/O device

Apps dont know how to talk to the hardware
App like browser cant be installed directly to the software 

APP <----> OS <----> hardware
OS - acts like a transalor, or middleware
  - manages resources among applications
  - isolates contents of applications

What are OS tasks
  1. Resource Allocation and Management
    a. Process Management - CPU
    What is a process - a small unit that executes in a computer
      - each process has own isolated space
    1 CPU - 1 process at a times - 1 task at a times
  
    b. Memory management - RAM - Rapid Access Memory
      - RAM - working memory
      - every app needs some data to work
      - RAM is limited on the hardware
      - Memory Swapping - when RAM  is full OS swaps memory between applications
        - unload memory to Storage, get Storage to RAM
        - will take some time
      
    c. Storage Management
      - Secondary memory - storage - persisting the data long Term 
      - data we want to save:
        produced files, code.

  2. Manage File System
    - data are stored in a structure way - directory/folder
    - in UNIX like systems, linux/MacOS - TREE FILE System
    - Windows OS - multiple root folders

  3. Management of IO devices
    - mouses, keyboards

  4. Security and Networking
    - managing users and permissions
    - each use has its own space
    - each use has its permissions
    - networking like assigning ports

OS components

1. Kernel 
  - the part that loads first
    - allocates resources to app for example
  - Heart of every operating System
  - Handle IO Devices
    driver <-----> IO Devices
  - Diff CPUs, diff Kernels
  - Kernel is a program

2. Application 
  - Ex diff Linux distros
    - Mint/Debian/Ubuntu/CentOS
  - Android is also based on Linux Kernel

  - MacOS and iOS are based from Darwin Kernel

  - OS for servers are mostly based on Linux

  - to interact with Kernel - GUI/continuously

  
User Apps <--> Application <--> Kernel <--> hardware
Ex:
  User Apps <--> Android <--> Linux Kernel <--> Hardware

3 Main OS
1. Linux
2. Windows
3. MacOS

-- Each OS has many versions
-- Kernel stays the same!! but the application layer is improving

Linux and Windows have server distributions
1. Client OS - GUI and I/O devices
2. Server OS - NO GUI or I/O devices, More lightweight
