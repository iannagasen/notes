Virtual machine

What if you want to use Linux on Windows OS??

With Virtualization
  - No separate hardware needed
  - You can add Linux OS on top of Windows OS thru Virtualization
  - You can achieve using HYPERVISOR Technology

Hypervisor allows hosting multiple virtual computers on a physical computers
  - ex: VirtualBox by Oracle

Virtual Machines are completely isolated.
  - adv, because if something breaks inside VM, it doesnot affect the host machine

Benefits of using a Virtual Machine
  1. Learning and experiment
  2. You don't endanger your main OS
  3. Test your app on different OS

Type 1 vs Type 2 Hypervisor
Type1 - For Big Servers
  - benefits for companies for their infrastructures
    - Efficient usage of hardware resources
    - users can choose any resource combination
    - ABSTRACTION of the Operating System from the hardware
      - w/o virtualization OS is tightly coupled to the hardware. One point of failure
      - w/ virtualization OS as a portable file as Virutal Machine Image (VMI)
        - all the apps(like database) and OS will be a file.
        - since it is a file, you can have backups of your entire OS

  With Virtualization, it is secure, portable and not dependent on the server

Type2 - For PC - aka Hoster Hypervisor

Virtual Machine has its own networking
- completely isolated from host network

if you scan devices from you home network
 - you can see the virtual machine
 - for security
